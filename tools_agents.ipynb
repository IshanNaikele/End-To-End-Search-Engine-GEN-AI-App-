       "'Page: Generative artificial intelligence\\nSummary: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI, GenAI, or GAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data. These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts.\\nGenerative AI tools have become more common since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs). Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude, Grok, and DeepSeek; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video models such as Veo and Sora. Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, Meta AI, Microsoft, Google, DeepSeek, and Baidu.\\nGenerative AI has raised many ethical questions and governance challenges as it can be used for cybercrime, or to deceive or manipulate people through fake news or deepfakes. Even if used ethically, it may lead to mass replacement of human jobs. The tools themselves have been criticized as violating intellectual property laws, since they are trained on copyrighted works. Generative AI is used across many industries, including software development, healthcare, finance, entertainment, customer service, sales and marketing, art, writing, fashion, and product design.\\n\\nPage: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\\nSummary: In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), a hallucination or artificial hallucination (also called bullshitting, confabulation, or delusion) is a response generated by AI that contains false or misleading information presented as fact. This term draws a loose analogy with human psychology, where hallucination typically involves false percepts. However, there is a key difference: AI hallucination is associated with erroneously constructed responses (confabulation), rather than perceptual experiences.\\nFor example, a chatbot powered by large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, may embed plausible-sounding random falsehoods within its generated content. Researchers have recognized this issue, and by 2023, analysts estimated that chatbots hallucinate as much as 27% of the time, with factual errors present in 46% of generated texts. Hicks, Humphries, and Slater, in their article in Ethics and Information Technology, argue that the output of LLMs is \"bullshit\" under Harry Frankfurt\\'s definition of the term, and that the models are \"in an important\\nway indifferent to the truth of their outputs\", with true statements only accidentally true, and false ones accidentally false. Detecting and mitigating these hallucinations pose significant challenges for practical deployment and reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. Software engineers and statisticians have criticized the specific term \"AI hallucination\" for unreasonably anthropomorphizing computers.\\n\\nPage: Artificial intelligence visual art\\nSummary: Artificial intelligence visual art means visual artwork generated (or enhanced) through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) programs.\\nAutomated art has been created since ancient times. The field of artificial intelligence was founded in the 1950s, and artists began to create art with artificial intelligence shortly after the discipline was founded. Throughout its history, AI has raised many philosophical concerns related to the human mind, artificial beings, and also what can be considered art in human–AI collaboration. Since the 20th century, people have used AI to create art, some of which has been exhibited in museums and won awards.\\nDuring the AI boom of the 2020s, text-to-image models such as Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX.1 became widely available to the public, allowing users to quickly generate imagery with little effort.

      "- **Debugging**: When an LLM returns an unexpected answer, you can step through the exact prompt, model response, and any tool calls that led to it.\n",
      "- **Cost control**: By visualizing token usage and latency per step, you can identify expensive calls and optimize prompts or model choices.\n",

      "### Typical workflow\n",
      "1. **Instrument your code** – add LangSmith’s tracer (often just a one‑line import) to your LangChain or custom LLM calls.\n",
      "2. **Run your application** – each execution is sent to LangSmith’s backend.\n",
      "3. **Inspect runs** – use the web UI or API to view a tree of calls, view raw prompts/responses, and see metrics.\n",
      "4. **Evaluate** – define evaluation functions (e.g., exact match, BLEU, custom rubric) and run them over stored outputs.\n",
      "5. **Iterate** – tweak prompts, switch models, or adjust chain logic, then compare new runs against previous ones.\n",

      "A neural network consists of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in the brain. Artificial neuron models that mimic biological neurons more closely have also been recently investigated and shown to significantly improve performance. These are connected by edges, which model the synapses in the brain. Each artificial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons. The \"signal\" is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the totality of its inputs, called the activation function. The strength of the signal at each connection is determined by a weight, which adjusts during the learning process.\n",
      "Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly passing through multiple intermediate layers (hidden layers). A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least two hidden layers.\n",

This includes hybrid methods that involve both classical and quantum processing, where computationally difficult subroutines are outsourced to a quantum device. These routines can be more complex in nature and executed faster on a quantum computer. Furthermore, quantum algorithms can be used to analyze quantum states instead of classical data.\n",

At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished. \n",
      "Transformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, therefore requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM). Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) on large (language) datasets.\n",

      "The modern version of the transformer was proposed in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by researchers at Google. Transformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation, but have found many applications since. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, audio, multimodal learning, robotics, and even playing chess. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers).\n",

      "Summary: A vision transformer (ViT) is a transformer designed for computer vision. A ViT decomposes an input image into a series of patches (rather than text into tokens), serializes each patch into a vector, and maps it to a smaller dimension with a single matrix multiplication. These vector embeddings are then processed by a transformer encoder as if they were token embeddings.\n",
      "ViTs were designed as alternatives to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision applications. They have different inductive biases, training stability, and data efficiency. Compared to CNNs, ViTs are less data efficient, but have higher capacity. Some of the largest modern computer vision models are ViTs, such as one with 22B parameters.\n",
      "Subsequent to its publication, many variants were proposed, with hybrid architectures with both features of ViTs and CNNs . ViTs have found application in image recognition, image segmentation, weather prediction, and autonomous driving.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mQuestion: Use Wikipedia to explain what a Transformer model is, and then find the original 'Attention Is All You Need' paper on ArXiv.  \n",
